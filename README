* Setting this up *                                                                                                                                                                               

* Clone the repo:

$ cd ~/
$ git clone git@github.com:arunagw/dot_files.git

* Create couple of symbolic links:

$ ln -s ~/dot_files/my_zshrc ~/.zshrc
$ ln -s ~/dot_files/irbrc ~/.irbrc
$ ln -s ~/dot_files/gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
$ mkdir ~/bin (if bin directory doesn't exist)
$ ln -s ~/sake ~/bin/sake
$ ln -s ~/dot_files/screenrc ~/.screenrc

* Modify ~/dot_files/my_zshrc

You may have to modify the my_zshrc file to your liking a bit. The PATH and
other stuff is configured according to the way, I have setup my machine.You may need to
change that.

* Switch to zsh :

$ chsh

* Close the terminal
* Logout from your active session.
* Open terminal and voila, you should have zsh with new prompt and everything working.
